								<b>Education:</b>
								I graduated with honors from El Capitan High School in Lakeside, California, in 2017. I then spent four years at Grossmont Community College in El Cajon exploring potential majors. After taking every math and physics class they offered, I transferred to the University of California, Berkeley in 2022 as a math major with the intent of pursuing a double major in physics. After a year, I decided I had enough of writing math proofs and decided to drop my math major, instead picking up a minor in astrophysics. I graduated December of 2024.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Work Experience:</b>
								My grandfather owned a small business in El Cajon, California, called Clearly Superior Technologies. He employed me for two years after high school until his retirement. During this time, I gained insight on the manufacturing of electronics with experience in assembly annd quality control. I was then hired by a neighboring company, Flagpole Buddy, where I was initially hired to oversee the 3D printing process of production parts. Over the three years I was there, I was given more responsibilities, including managing inventory, assembly, and shipping, as well as training and supervising new employees. I left the company in 2022 to move to Berkeley and pursue my education full-time.
