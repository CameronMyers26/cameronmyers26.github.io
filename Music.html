<p>Click on an artist to see their albums and descriptions.<br>Artists are in alphabetical order, but I list the albums in order of my most liked to least liked. These are subject to change but if I'm really familiar with an artist I'll put a star next to their name. I also may not include a description for every one of these.</p>

I love the yin-yang almost dynamic on the pacing of this album and the story as well.", "Realistically, most people would say this should be lower, but I love this album. Its like losing your mind and then being able to tune back in to some great tracks. What an experience.", "Honestly if I included chloroform, drown with me, and futile from the deluxe version, I could be happy putting this above Signify.
